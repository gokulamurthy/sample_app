User Model is used to create a new user with a variety of associations in my previous project/product called "WebWrite" or "Website Builder". 

In this model, i have written bunch of validations and associations. This class contains few class methods and instant methods. 

User Model is the one "root" of our product. 

So it has some important and powerful functionalities like creating an user, getter, setter methods and destroying the user details.


Here we are ignored the basic CRUD operations generated by scaffold, because here we are inserting the user details, while placing the order, itself.


This sample code which represents the concept of "Fat Model and Skinny Controller".
